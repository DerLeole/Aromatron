__Aromatron v1__
Melitta Aromaboy automation, making coffee whenever the included alarm rings.

#_General_
Designed for an Arduino Nano, RTC, I2C LCD screen, rotary encoder, one button, two LEDs, a relais, and a buzzer.
I will include a detailed schematic someday.
Will probably work on other hardware too.

#_Setup_
Setup the above mentioned devices to your arduino and put them on the pins as describe in the code.
Install the relais inside the coffee machine and route it to a 3 pole female plug at the bottom or side.
Install the other stuff inside a 3D printed housing and connect it to the coffee machine using a 3 pole male plug.
Load the code into the ArduinoIDE and flash it to your device.
